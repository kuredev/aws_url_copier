# aws_url_copier
This extension removes the session part from AWS Management Console multi-session URLs before copying them.

## Example  
The URL `https://000000000000-aaaaaaaa.us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1` will be copied as `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1`.
